# deep learning gpu benchmarks
11/12/2018

Here is a list of GPU benchmarking projects specifically for deep learning / matching learning.

### Tools / Scripts
* [deep learning benchmark](https://github.com/u39kun/deep-learning-benchmark)
	* This project benchmarks both 32bit and 16bit float point neural network training and eval performance on GPU. It benchmarks both Tensorflow and PyTorch performance. Recommended for general GPU evaluation.
* [Google] [Tensorflow benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks)
	* As the name suggests, this is Tensorflow only. Not as comprehensive as [deep learning benchmark](https://github.com/u39kun/deep-learning-benchmark), but since it's from Tensorflow project, it's perfect if you only cares about Tensorflow performance.
* [Baidu] [DeepBench](https://github.com/baidu-research/DeepBench)
* [HPE] [Deep Learning Benchmarking Suite](https://hewlettpackard.github.io/dlcookbook-dlbs/#/)

### Suites
* [Stanford] [DAWNBench](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/benchmark/)
	* Focus on ML Model + Hardware + Deep learning framework. Not suitable for benchmark just a single GPU, but good for benchmark cloud providers etc.
* [MLPerf](https://mlperf.org/)
	* A broad ML benchmark suite for measuring performance of ML software frameworks, ML hardware accelerators, and ML cloud platforms.
